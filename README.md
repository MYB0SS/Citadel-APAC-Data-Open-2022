### Description
The APAC Datathon Report presents a comprehensive analysis of Medicaid and Medicare payments for cancer treatments in the United States. It aims to determine the fairness and efficiency of these payments and their impact on cancer mortality rates. The report addresses questions related to outliers in payment amounts by state, correlation between cancer mortality rates and Medicaid payments, and factors contributing to cancer infection rates.

### Key Findings

1. Use of the Isolation Forest model for identifying outliers in payment data
2. Weak correlation between external socio-economic factors and cancer mortality rates
3. Importance of equitable resource allocation and policy changes to address disparities in cancer mortality rates
